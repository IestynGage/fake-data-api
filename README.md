# fake data api

Generates fake data for ends points that have been set up to do so.

## How to get started

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm server
```

## How I would take this further?

1. Remove the `Set` that lists all the endpoint and connect to a database to manage the data.
2. Allow `post` endpoint to create a new endpoint to add rules on the returned fake data
3. Have a config file you can give on start up
4. Allow the host/ports to be customizable via env variable
